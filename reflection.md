# Introduction
For my placement I worked as an ITS Intern within Bard Ltd, a company that is a global leader in its industry for developing innovative medical devices for people around the world. During my year I worked predominantly as an end user support and service desk member.

On a daily basis I dealt with an array of problems and tasks from basic issues such as locked accounts to issues with the Windows OS and Microsoft Office. I also preformed in-depth checks on reports that were run using J.D Edwards to ensure they had run successfully and had not produced any errors.

These daily tasks really helped me to realise and appreciate the variety of issues I could face on a day to day basis and I feel that I learned a lot about what it would be like if I continue onto a career as an end user support and service desk member both in terms of the knowledge needed for the jobs and the communication skills required.


# Disaster Data Recovery Training

Each year the infrastructure team take part in a 2 day data recovery training session at the IBM server site in Greenford, this is for multiple reasons; it ensures that data being stored off site via Magnetic tape is intact and all accounted for, to account for any variation in the recovery process since the last recovery session and to ensure everyone knows how to restore key systems as quickly as possible to reduce downtime a server failure may cause.

During the two days I shadowed several members of the team to observe each role and see how each persons dedicated knowledge is essential to the recovery process. There were many steps involved with most being dependent on several other aspects. The initial step involved was simply a matter of loading the tapes to begin the data copy, a process that was lengthy but allowed time for myself and others in my team to begin spinning up servers and the virtual machines that run upon them.

As with most things in IT this did not go smoothly with several unforeseen issues occurring, first and foremost with the IBM contract. The external broadband connection within the contract had lapsed resulting in no external internet access which was required to connect to Crawley site. To overcome this we had to... **(Explain briefly (and technically) what you did)**
There were also issues with configuring the virtual machines as they failed to detect the hardware support for virtualisation. This required us to research and apply a work around found by the server architect. On top of this we experienced issues with restoring some data to the server once it had been started, however this was not critical data and was not seen as an immediate issue.

At the end of the first day after starting at around 9am and calling it a day at just past 6pm all critical systems were back up and running with some extra systems started and most data restored. I was aware from my observations at Bard that during a real crisis this would not be the case and myself and my team would have worked through the night to fully restore the system.

 In the evening we all went for a meal as a team and had time to talk and relax before the next day, it was especially nice for me to be able to talk to members of the team who I did not get to see often for example colleagues who worked from home and get their views on the days training.

Over the 2 days IBM were able to fulfil mostly any need required and were quickly able to provide the broadband access needed; this alone made it clear to me performing these sessions were crucial to outline any issues in the recovery process. Anything and everything can potentially go wrong and it is critical to have processes and reviews of those processes in place not just for large companies but any company as disasters can happen in any situation.

One key point that I will take away from this exercise is that any issue can be resolved as long as I work systematically and logically. By applying my new learnt skills, working as a team and breaking large tasks into smaller manageable ones we were able to restore the critical components along with several others for the entirety Europe and emerging markets network in just one day.

Overall the training session taught me that although a basic knowledge of different IT platforms and roles is advantageous in most if not all IT career paths everyone has their own specialities and experiences and these can be used to help others troubleshoot and resolve issues by either first hand help or the documentation of processes and procedures. Using process documentation really helped me during both the data recovery training and in my main role at Bard to overcome obstacles I faced without causing a time delay that would affect the company.

# Project Mobilise
##### Phone upgrade and carrier porting

<!-- #### What? (description) #### What happened? Who was involved? -->

The scheme *Project Mobilise* was brought in to save money for the company, originally with Vodafone the usage of most users was regularly exceeding the allowance in data and minutes costing in some cases thousands for a handful for of users in extra fees. Many users travel abroad regularly and are often out of the office for three weeks in a month resulting in extra fees from usage abroad. This resulted in the finance department being prompted into finding better deals either with Vodafone or a competitor; after approaching multiple providers it was decided to change over to EE as they provided the best deals and would allow the company to combine its overseas phone contracts in line with EE or a sisters company.

With over 200 users within the scope of Bard ltd and nearly an extra 100 to be distributed to the recently acquired Rochester medical a couple of months later a big task was ahead.  Two of my colleagues produced the lists of users and mobile numbers of the users that would need porting over, however due to holiday and sickness both were unreachable the week prior to the change date. Alex another one of my colleagues who mainly deals with infrastructure was put forward to take on the large task having to pick up where the others left off and fill in the gaps that had yet to be filled.

Alex not having expected this extra workload and having his own work to contend with as well as dealing with all of these issues struggled. He was meant to be contacting users to provide details and to obtain dates suitable for transfers as well as checking whether staff would be able to collect their phones or if they would need them dispatching however time constraints made it difficult for him. I decided that I had to do something to help.

The time leading up to change consisted of multiple calls daily from different users requesting confirmation and more information on the change process; to assist I typed up documentation dealing with the porting process and how to backup and restore an iPhone to transfer the data and keep all contact information, I also took as many calls as I could in order to stabilise the incoming workload.

I discovered that as most members of staff work remotely and some of them abroad it was difficult to obtain a complete list of people that would be in need of having their devices sent to their home address. Another issue was which day would be suitable for dispatch, luckily we were able to work quickly as a team to get the phones dispatched two days prior to the changeover date before 16:00 which allowed us to use next day delivery. With several of us packaging and labelling the devices, they were ready for posting quickly resulting in every member of staff getting their phones before the change date.

On the day of porting many users experienced lack of service from either their Vodafone device or their EE devices; in rare cases both and for much longer than the stated hour from EE, this caused a lot of users to contact the help desk, unfortunately when I contacted EE they explained that Vodafone had yet to release the numbers causing the delay. Many users accepted this was an issue and understood they would need to continue performing the steps I had outlined and most within an hour would regain service.

It was clear that this task was too much to be handled by one person alone and I am happy to report that the documentation I had created was used companywide to assist users and helped greatly towards reducing the service desk calls and helping myself and my colleagues meet our deadline for this project.

During my year I have been shown a lot of new things **(give a few examples)** and have witnessed some very talented IT technicians and software specialists **(Right job roles? – big it up)**. This has really influenced me towards an IT Career in the future, I enjoyed these aspects of the job role **(List)** whilst I found these aspects **(list)** quite challenging. I believe the time I have spent there has really begun to give me an idea of what direction I would like to go in and has helped me to visualise a career plan for the future.

What to include

Here are some tips on what to include in your reflective writing:

Don't just describe – explore and explain what happened.
Be honest – it's ok to admit to making mistakes as well as success. But you should also show how you understand why things happen and what you are going to do to improve.
Be selective – you don’t have to write about everything that happened, just key events or ideas.
Look to the future – reflect on what happened in the past and how it will have an impact on future ideas or activities. -->
